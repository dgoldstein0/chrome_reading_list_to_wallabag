# Chrome Reading List to Wallabag Migrator

This is the start of a Chrome extension to read Chrome's reading list and migrate things on it to Wallabag.  So far, it manages to query the reading list.

Rough idea:
- be able to migrate all entries on the reading list to wallabag
- ... without creating duplicates
- ... and ideally share what title / html is already known
- ... and tag the migrated articles (for easier understanding if something goes wrong)
- ... and be able to remove stuff in wallabag from Chrome's reading list.

So roughly a 2-way sync that removes stuff from Chrome reading list and adds them to wallabag.
